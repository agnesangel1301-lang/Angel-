🧠 How It Works

The user writes a comment in the textarea and clicks Post Comment.

The comment appears below instantly.

When the page is closed or reloaded, the script automatically saves comments to localStorage.

On page load, previously saved comments are restored.

🧩 Possible Improvements

Add edit and delete buttons for each comment.

Include timestamps for when comments are posted.

Integrate a backend (Node.js, Firebase, or PHP) to store comments on a server.

Add user authentication and avatars.
